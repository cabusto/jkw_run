At some point during your running journey, running faster becomes a goal. Maybe it’s to qualify for Boston, or break a time threshold or to beat your neighbor for bragging rights. This may have led to the purchase of running books, like Faster Road Running, Jack Daniels or Hanson. You may be asking the fastest person in your running club for tips. Maybe you’ve even bought a fancy device and followed a prepared plan.

Those are all great options but they can sometimes lead to mental and physical fatigue, overtraining and possibly injury. 

But what if I told you that there are some ways to get faster, without trying? Of course you have to try, but these tips require no additional expenditure or effort on your part.

Here are my tips to get faster without trying. These three tips require virtually no effort - and could be even less than you are doing now!

1. Effort: Reduce your effort level in general. The classic advice you hear often is SLOW DOWN but most rarely do it or think they are doing it but they’re still not running at a slow enough pace. This makes running easier, more fun, less taxing and as an added bonus, you’ll want to do it more.
2. Consistency: If you run 3 times a week for 40 min each, try 5 or 6 runs at 20 - 30 min each instead. This makes it easier to get your shoes on, knock out a run and make it a habit. The running stress is spread out, allowing for better recovery. Running on recovered legs means better technique - better technique makes your stride more efficient, and efficiency is the key to speed.
3. Variety: Say YES more often.

   * Friends doing a trail run? YES. 
   * Friends doing a track workout? YES. 
   * Significant other who is a different speed than you, YES! 

Running with others is fun, and the suffering goes down in a group.
